Understanding which properties are able to command higher prices can help hosts and Airbnb optimize pricing strategies, target luxury markets, and enhance features in listings that are proven to attract high-paying customers. However, if these high prices are out of sync with customer expectations or the value provided, it could lead to negative growth due to customer dissatisfaction or negative reviews. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that high prices are justified by the quality and uniqueness of the experience offered."],"metadata":{"id":"ey_0qi68phqO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Chart - 9"],"metadata":{"id":"YJ55k-q6phqO"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Chart - 9 visualization code"],"metadata":{"id":"B2aS4O1ophqO"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Chart - 9 visualization code\n","room_type_counts = df['room_type'].value_counts()\n","\n","plt.pie(room_type_counts, labels=room_type_counts.index, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\n","plt.title('Distribution of Room Types')\n","plt.figure(figsize=(4,4))\n","plt.show()"],"metadata":{"id":"hvrljNIKrwBS"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##### 1.
